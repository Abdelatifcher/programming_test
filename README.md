# programming_test
## Welcome to Aequam Capital’s programming test !

This test is designed to evaluate your Python programming skills. It should take you about 2 hours, although time spent is not an evaluation criterion.

We ask you to:



*   Fork this repository to your own Github account ;
*   Commit your own solution (only `test.py` should be modified but you can as many files / documents as you want in your commit)
*   Send us the link to your forked repository once you’re done. **Do not create a Pull Request** as your solution might be copied by other candidates.

The folder data contains two files : `data.csv` contains the _Eurostoxx 50_ total return price history and this is the financial series you should use to test your functions ; `output.csv` contains the same series as well as the expected output for the `macd` function you should create in `test.py`.

The most important file is `test.py` : it contains some functions you have to fill and, in comments, the requested behaviour of the described function. You are not expected to know these ratios / functions and it’s part of the exercise to see how you search for help on the internet and implement the found solutions.

Writing these 5 functions, you are going to be evaluated on the following aspects:



*   **Functionality**: your code should produce the expected output without execution error ;
*   **Readability**: your code should be easily readable for standard users. Feel free to comment or add documentation to your code ;
*   **Efficiency**: your code should perform the requested task in an efficient way, without doing unnecessary calculations.

If you can’t manage to answer some of these questions, please provide explanations of what your problem was and how you tried to solve it.

Best of luck,

Aequam Capital's research team
